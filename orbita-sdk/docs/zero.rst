Zero
----

In this version, Orbita's encoder are positionned before the reduction. Thus, we do not have absolute position on the full 360° circle.

To make sure, your Orbita is always correctly calibrated, there are a few steps to follow:

1. First, the zero hardware must be recorded. A specific 3D part has been designed for this purpose. The hardware zero has already been stored inside Orbita's memory, so you shouldn't have anything to do. **This step is only required with a brand new Orbita** or if the motors were disassemble from the mechanics. See the specific notebook (TODO) for more information on how to do this.

2. Then, you need to make sure you start Orbita "close" from its indicated position. See the image below TODO. It does not have to be really precise, but you should not be at more than 90° from the base position.
